# ParallelRoomScheduler
Simple console menu driven room scheduler framework.

This simple room scheduler console application makes it easier to create rooms, delete rooms, schedule meeting for the 
rooms and much more. It can import and export rooms (think of this as something like No SQL persistence functionality).
The room scheduler has error checking to handle errors and conflicts. An important feature of PrallelRoomScheduler is 
that we can schedule meetings in parallel.
